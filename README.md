# Lightweight_NoSQL
Use assembly language to establish a hash. I use this established a small size NoSQL database. High search speed and run stable. Every line is optimized. Just like inc ebx. We don’t use add ebx,1. Because the former one is 10 times faster than the latter one. 

The encryption and decryption function which can be used as adding access control on NoSQL database. With very low overhead. If add an agent between NoSQL database and user. So we don’t need to change codes of NoSQL database to achieve data encryption and access control.
